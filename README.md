# Handwritten Digit Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on building a robust machine learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. Handwritten digit classification is a classic problem in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition, where the goal is to correctly classify digits (0-9) written in various styles by different individuals.


## Problem Statement
In many real-world applications, there is a need to automate the process of recognizing handwritten characters. This can be particularly useful in scenarios such as:

*Banking Sector:*
Automating the process of reading and verifying handwritten digits on checks can significantly speed up transactions, reduce errors, and lower operational costs.

*Postal Services:*
Efficiently sorting and reading handwritten postal codes helps in faster and more accurate mail delivery, improving overall postal service efficiency.

*Education:*
Grading handwritten exam papers and assignments can be automated, providing instant feedback to students and reducing the workload on educators.

*Healthcare:*
Digitizing handwritten medical records and prescriptions to maintain accurate patient data and facilitate quick retrieval of information.


## Project Highlights
1) Importing necessary libraries and MNSIT Dataset: We used tensorflow, numpy, keras, to work with our dataset and make model's architechture. We used matplotlib and searborn to depict our model's progress and accuracy graphically.

2) Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the MNIST dataset to ensure high-quality input for the model.

3) Model Architecture: Designed and trained a 3 layered Neural Network that achieves high accuracy in digit recognition.

4) Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using various metrics and visualized its predictions to understand its strengths and areas for improvement.

5) Deployment: Provided a streamlined process for deploying the model using Flask, allowing for easy integration with web applications.

## Results and Performance
Our model achieves an impressive accuracy of 98% on the test dataset, showcasing its ability to generalize well to unseen data. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations can be found in the accompanying Google Colab Notebook.

## Future Work
1) Enhancements: Experiment with different neural network architectures and hyperparameters to further improve the model's accuracy.

2) Data Augmentation: Implement data augmentation techniques to make the model more robust to variations in handwriting styles.

3) Transfer Learning: Explore transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models for potentially better performance.

4) Deployment: Improve the deployment pipeline for easier integration into real-world applications.
